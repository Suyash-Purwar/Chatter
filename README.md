# Chatter

Chatter is a real-time chatting application I built as a side project. I wrote this application for my friends and some teachers. This application is restricted to be used by my friends and teachers.

**Note**: The database for this application is hosted on mLab, which has merged with MongoDB and became MongoDB Atlas. Because of that, this application no longer works.
